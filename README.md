## ðŸš€ Overview
**Serverless CSV Cleaner** is an event-driven AWS pipeline that automatically validates, cleans, and de-duplicates CSV files.  
When a new file is uploaded to an S3 bucket, it triggers a Lambda function that:
- Removes duplicates  
- Validates required fields  
- Quarantines invalid rows  
- Writes the clean and bad files to separate S3 buckets  
- Sends an SNS notification summarizing the results  

Built with **Python 3.12**, **AWS Lambda**, **S3 Events**, **SNS**, and **CloudWatch Logs** â€” all following best practices for security and observability.
